# Slantbot

Slantbot scans a list of approved subreddits searching for comments starting with its invocation command, for example `@whatarethebest Q&A websites for subjective questions`. Queries are harvested from the first line of such comments, and forwarded to Slant.co's search interface. Results are parsed, formatted and returned as a reply to the triggering comment. Additionally, it forwards any direct messages it receives to a maintainer's account. The subreddit list is read in from a remote SQL database; other configuration (usernames, API codes, etc.) are provided through environment variables.

The code is modular and extensible, and many parts could be useful to other projects.

- The actions performed within a subreddit are separate from the scanning mechanism, so the "skeleton" of Slantbot can be used for basically any reddit bot. In any case, it uses the Haskell [reddit library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reddit) and should serve as good example code for that.

- While the Algolia query composition is merely "good enough", the associated JSON results parser is generic, and complete as far as I've been able to discover, needing only a schema for the user data (which can be partial).

- `Main.hs` is generic even beyond the bot: it reads in configuration, then spawns a list of threads, which currently happens to be a singleton list of just the reddit bot, but could be anything (commented lines there hint at a future plan). Anyone curious about threads in Haskell should take a look, because it's almost embarrassingly simple. :)
